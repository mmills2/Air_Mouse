# Air Mouse
Air Mouse lets you control your mouse using your camera to track your hand and recognize hand gestures. The mouse matches the movement of your hand and the recognized hand gestures control different mouse functions like left and right click.

# How to Install
To begin, you must have Python version 3.10 installed. You can either downgrade/upgrade your Python version to match this version or create a virtual environment with Python 3.10.
Next, you will have to install two libraries: MediaPipe and mouse. MediaPipe is a library that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning for a wide range of solutions but this project will only use the hand tracking and gesture recognition soltuion. mouse is a library that allows you to programmatically control your mouse.
To install MediaPipe, run the following command in your command line: 
# python -m pip install mediapipe

To install mouse, run the following command in your command line:
# python -m pip install mouse

Now that you have the correct version of Python and the libraries installed, you're good to download this project's code and run the code in your programming environment.
